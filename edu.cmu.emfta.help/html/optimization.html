<h1>About the Optimization/Factorization/Expansion feature</h1>
<p>
These functions help to to improve the representation of the tree.
Often (especially when being generated from another notations),
the Fault-Tree can be big and hard to read or understand.
Our objective is to provide tools that help the user
to remove useless or noisy information so that engineers
can focus on the core issues of the model.
</p>
<p>
We propose three ways to improve the fault-tree:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Optimization</strong>: remove redundant events or gate in the tree</li>
	<li><strong>Factorization</strong>: re-organize the tree in order to remove
										events that occur several time in the same tree.</li>
	<li><strong>Expansion</strong>: expand the <strong>orless</strong> or <strong>ormore</strong> gates</li>
</ul>

<h1>Optimization</h1>
<p>
Optimization removes redundant information in the Fault-Tree, when the same
event is present in several gates in the tree hierarchy.Take for example
the following tree (see picture below). The elements P1 or referenced by all
the <strong>OR</strong> gates. It can be only in the first gate
because no matter what, the event will trigger a failure. It does
not need to be in the gates below. Once we remove the references
in the gates below, the <strong>OR</strong> gates at the bottom
are empty. We can then remove them and just keep the <strong>AND</strong>
gate.</p>

<p>This results in the following FTA tree. It reduces two gates and improves it
readability.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the tool can perform the optimization function with shared events
on multiples <strong>OR</strong> gates. Gate types <strong>ORMORE</strong> or
<strong>ORLESS</strong> are currently not supported. One workaround is to expand
these gates first and then, perform the factorization. 
</p>

<p>
In order to use the optimization, the user should click on the event to optimize,
right click and select <em>optimize tree</em>, as shown below.
The optimize operation can be performed on any event in the tree. The operation
is performed within the leaves below the selected event.

<h1>Factorization</h1>
<p>
Factorization re-organizes the Fault-Tree, especially when sub-trees share events. The following picture shows an example of
a tree with <strong>OR</strong> gates that share a common event: <strong>P1</strong>.</p>

<p>This tree can then be updated by putting the common error on top and have
the <strong>AND</strong> gate under. This reduces the number of gates in the tree
and facilitates its analysis.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the tool can perform the same operation for the <strong>AND</strong>
and <strong>OR</strong> gates. Other types, such as <strong>ORMORE</strong> or
<strong>ORLESS</strong> are currently not supported. One workaround is to expand
these gates first and then, perform the factorization. 
</p>

<p>
In order to use the factorization, the user should click on the event to optimize,
right click and select <em>factorization</em>, as shown below.
The factorization operation can be performed on any event in the tree. The operation
is performed within the leaves below the selected event.
