<h1>What is EMFTA?</h1>
<p>
EMFTA is an EMF implementation of a Fault-Tree Analysis
tool. It uses the Sirius framework for the representation.
It includes some basic analysis tools.

<h1>What is a Fault-Tree?</h1>
<p>
Wikipedia is magical and has all the answers! You
can read a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis">description here</a>.
</p>

<h1>Where can I find examples?</h1>
<p>
You can find examples on our github repository,
under the 
<a target="blank" href="https://github.com/juli1/emfta/tree/master/example.emfta">example.emfta</a> project.
</p>

<h1>What is a Cutset?</h1>
<p>
A cutset is the list of events that are required to raise an error.
Each model has one or several cutset, each of them
identifies the combination of errors that will trigger
an error in the system.
</p>

<h1>What is AADL and OSATE?</h1>
<p>
AADL stands for Architecture Analysis and Design Language.
This is a modeling language to capture software and system
architectures. OSATE is the modeling framework that
supports the AADL language. As EMFTA, 
it is implemented within Eclipse.
The AADL has an extension to specify errors
and failures. We then add a bridge between EMFTA and OSATE
to automatically generate Fault-Tree from AADL models.
