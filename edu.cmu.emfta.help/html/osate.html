<h1>Export from AADL to EMFTA</h1>
<p>
The AADL modeling language has a capability to specify errors and
failures in an architecture model. It already has a bridge
to several fault-tree analysis tools, either commercial or open-source.
The EMFTA bridge adds the capability to export the safety
information from AADL to EMFTA.
</p>
<p>
The big advantage of such an approach is that everything resides
in Eclipse: the architecture (AADL) model but also the FTA model.
It makes the tool usage more easy and consistent and avoid to switch
from one tool to another.
</p>


<h1>Export from AADL to EMFTA</h1>
<p>
To generate the EMFTA model from the AADL model, proceed as follow:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the instance model you would like to use to generate the EMFTA model</li>
	<li>Right click and select the OSATE analysis submenu and finally select the EMFTA export (figure 1)</li>
	<li>Select the failure mode to process (figure 2). Two kind of failure modes can be selected: AADL <em>error state</em> or <em>outgoing error propagation</em></li>
</ol>
<p>
Once complete, a file with the <em>emfta</em> is generated in the project, as shown in figure 3. You can then open it with EMFTA. Do not forget to 
switch to the <em>Modeling (or Sitius)</em> perspective in your environment, convert
the project to a modeling project but also use the appropriate representation.
