It then creates a new file at the root directory
of your project. The file can be opened with a Spreadsheet program
(such as Excel or LibreOffice).
EMFTA can produce two types of files:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><em>All cutset in a single sheet</em>: convenient
	if the cutsets are small for the FTA does not have too
	many events.
	</li>
	<li><em>One sheet per cutset</em>: appropriate for large
	model with many events.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the following, we explain how to switch from
one report type to the other.
</p>


<h1>Cutset Generation Preferences</h1>
<p>
You can change the type of report by
going into the EMFTA preferences in the Eclipse
preferences. You can then select the type of 
of report you would like to generate, as shown below.
