<h1>What is a Cutset</h1>
As <a href="http://www.weibull.com/hotwire/issue63/relbasics63.htm">defined there</a>:
<em>"cut sets are the unique combinations of component failures that can cause system failure.
Specifically, a cut set is said to be a minimal cut set if, when any basic event is removed
from the set, the remaining events collectively are no longer a cut set"</em>.

In other words, a cut set is a set of error events combination that can trigger a system failure.
EMFTA has the capability to generate the minimal cutset.


<h1>Cutset Generation in EMFTA</h1>
<p>
In order to generate the cutset from an EMFTA model, 
select the top-level event you want to analyze and 
select the option <em>Generate Cutset</em>.

It then creates a new file at the root directory
of your project. The file can be opened with a Spreadsheet program
(such as Excel or LibreOffice).
EMFTA can produce two types of files:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><em>All cutset in a single sheet</em>: convenient
	if the cutsets are small for the FTA does not have too
	many events.
	</li>
	<li><em>One sheet per cutset</em>: appropriate for large
	model with many events.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the following, we explain how to switch from
one report type to the other.
</p>


<h1>Cutset Generation Preferences</h1>
<p>
You can change the type of report by
going into the EMFTA preferences in the Eclipse
preferences. You can then select the type of 
of report you would like to generate, as shown below.
